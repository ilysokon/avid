Collaboration App: Test

Overview

Design and implement generic container for items in a tree of arbitrary structure. Container allows the following:

1. store items
2. build/modify/access tree structure

add/remove children of a particular parent

get subtrees starting from the particular parent

3. search for items based on filters Functional Requirements

**Todo (required):**

design and implement classes required to build generic tree structure

design and implement generic search interface(s)

implement search interface(s) for any type of data as example of search filter usage

(search component is expected to handle any arbitrary filters for any arbitrary data type)

* meaningful exception handling
* search for items based on filters

**Todo+ (optional)**

· design and implement tree manager allowing to define max child count based on the parent node

· design and implement meaningful event model so it provides ability for the clients to react on tree structure modifications

Expected implementation time: 4-6 hours.

If stated time is not enough, please, spend any sensible amount required to provide decent implementation.

This task is expected to reflect you expertise and knowledge so be wise trading off time and quality.

NOTE

You are expected to implement your understanding of the requirements (todos) listed above. However if you are absolutely bewildered by some of them, please, feel free to clarify (send your questions to the contact person who’s provided this task for you).
